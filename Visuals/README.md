# Figures Directory

This directory contains all visual outputs generated by the unified multi-axis robustness pipeline. These figures correspond to the empirical analysis presented in the research notebook and are used for interpretation, comparison, and inclusion in the research paper.

## Figure Overview

### 1. Full-Sample Statistics
- **01_full_mean_bar.png** — Bar chart of full-sample mean returns across all assets.  
- **02_full_mean_ci.png** — Confidence interval visualization for mean returns.  

### 2. Regime-Level Analysis
- **03_regime_comparison.png** — Comparison of mean/volatility across different market regimes.  
- **regime_vol_plot.png** — Regime-wise volatility distribution.  

### 3. Unified Robustness vs Baseline
- **cum_oos_unified_vs_1n.png** — Cumulative out-of-sample performance of the unified ensemble vs. 1/N benchmark.  
- **pairwise_sharpe_plot.png** — Pairwise Sharpe ratio comparison between robustness axes and baselines.  

### 4. Sensitivity Analyses
- **04_sensitivity.png** — Aggregated sensitivity analysis across robustness parameters.  
- **05_tc_sensitivity.png** — Sensitivity of performance to transaction-cost assumptions.  
- **06_window_sensitivity.png** — Effects of varying rolling-window lengths on portfolio stability.  

## Notes

- Figures are produced automatically by the notebook in `notebooks/robustness.ipynb`.  
- All visuals use consistent formatting for reproducibility and publication readiness.  
- These figures are referenced in the results discussion and may appear in the paper’s empirical section or appendix.
