# Results Directory

This directory contains all intermediate and final output artifacts generated by the unified multi-axis robustness pipeline. These files support full reproducibility of the empirical analysis and correspond to the simulations, robustness tests, and summary metrics used in the research paper.

## File Overview

### 1. Summary Metrics
These files contain aggregated performance metrics for the unified robustness ensemble across the full evaluation period.

- **gross_summary.csv** — Gross returns, volatility, and risk metrics before transaction costs.
- **net_summary.csv** — Net performance metrics after applying transaction costs.
- **turnover_summary.csv** — Portfolio turnover statistics and transaction-cost impact.

### 2. Test-Specific Results
Outputs from controlled experiments designed to analyze the effect of individual robustness axes or hyperparameters.

- **test1_2.csv** — Baseline comparison between shrinkage and bootstrap components.
- **test3_ablation.csv** — Ablation results isolating each axis of robustness.
- **test4_sensitivity.csv** — Sensitivity analysis across varying shrinkage levels and bootstrap sample sizes.
- **test5_tc.csv** — Performance impact across different transaction cost assumptions.
- **test6_window.csv** — Robustness across rolling-window lengths for covariance estimation.

### 3. Pipeline Metadata
Files that document configuration details and source-code structure for reproducibility.

- **config.json** — All experiment parameters, including tickers, window lengths, bootstrap settings, and ensemble weights.
- **pipeline_source.txt** — Text export of the pipeline code for verification and archival.

### 4. Serialized State
Objects saved to allow full reconstruction of the experiment environment.

- **pipe_base.pkl** — Serialized base pipeline object containing intermediate covariance estimates, model state, and cached results.

## Notes

- All files in this directory are generated outputs.  
- No raw market data is stored here for licensing reasons.  
- The notebook in `notebooks/robustness.ipynb` describes how each file is produced.  
- Results may be updated as theoretical refinements and additional experiments are completed.
